# Backbone Project

After completing this project you should understand and apply:

* Client side templating
* Basic Backbone.js development
* Using build tools to aid your development process

For this project you'll be converting the album widget project to a working Backbone.js application. Backbone.js is a client-side MVC framework for professional-level web application development.


## Getting setup



### Install the build tool

Brunch is a build tool for client-side application development and it includes the ability to run a local server along with a slew of other nice features that we'll be taking advantage of in this project.

#### Installation Instructions
* Installing on [Windows](http://www.axelscript.com/2013/02/06/installing-brunch-io-on-windows/)
* Installing on [Mac](http://blog.stevenlu.com/2012/05/04/brunchio-on-mac-osx/)


### Install and run the project template

You'll be submitting this project using a source code control sytemn called Git. The code itself will be hosted on [Github](http://github.com). This will allow easy review of code.

I've created a template repository to get you started with Brunch and Backbone.

To get started:

1. [Install Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git). 
2. [Create a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) of this repository and pull it to your computer.
3. Run the project on your computer using the following commands in your terminal:
```shell
cd ~/<path-to-your-project-folder>
npm install
brunch w -s
```
Once you've done that, you should be able to open a brower to `http://localhost:3333/` and see the text "Hello World!" displayed on the screen.
